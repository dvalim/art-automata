These are the algorithms used in generating images for the Facebook page [@artautomata](https://www.facebook.com/artautomata/). See the /images/ folder for sample output.

Some are original, some inspired by other people's work - credit is given where appropriate. To run these, you'll need [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/).
